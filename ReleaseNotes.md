**dynamic perks**
Over the past few releases we've been trialling custom perk trees for different backgrounds, and your feedback has been overwhelmingly positive about this idea. While running these trials, we have also been building up a perk library, with the goal of massively increasing the perks available to all mercenaries.
With this release we have gone all out and given every mercenary you hire a unique perk tree. We have assembled a library of over 260 perks, then arranged them into groups of perks that have synergy together.
We then assigned those groups by hand to each background, so that every background had gauranteed access to thematically appropriate perks.
However, those background groups only make up half of each mercenary's tree. The other half is randomly picked from the perk groups, providing variety while retaining the synergies.
Each mercenary gets 6 of the 15 weapon groups, 2 of the five defence groups, and eight from the 13 traits, 8 enemy groups and 6 class groups. This provides millions of possible combinations.

Unarmed skills
Unarmed skill has always been strong in legends, it scales off initiative and hitpoints. Now there are three new perks to give more depth:
New Perk 'Kicking' - Active skill to push back and fatigue enemies
New Perk 'Grappling' - Active skill to stun and fatigue enemies
New Perk 'Unarmed Mastery' -Reduces fatigue and increase armor penetration unarmed attacks
Of course brawlers are gaurantees all three.

Medium armor skills
There is a very strong nimble vs battleforged divide that drives mercenaries to the extremes. We wanted to break this dichotomy and encourage other kinds of armor.
New Perk 'Balance' grants up to 30 bonuse melee and ranged defense if your current body armor is equal to twice your current initiative. The bonus decreases for every point of difference between the two, to a minimum of +5.
New Perk 'Matching Set' grants up to 5 fatigue per round if your helmet and armor values match.
New Perk 'Lithe' - Like nimble, but with the 15 fatigue floor raised to 30, and the damage mititgation reduced.

Bard class
You'll find minstrels and troubadours have some new tricks up their sleeves, having gained Daze and Entice to control the battlefield. They also have
New Perk 'Drums Of War' - active skill to reduce the fatigue of all allies

Stealth skills
Devious backgrounds can get a little sneaky
New Perk 'Camouflage' - Master of concelement and blending in. Can hide from enemies in any terrain until next attack or moving adjacent to enemy. Can't be activated if adjacent to enemy.
New Perk 'Blend In' - Makes enemies 50% less likely to attack you instead of someone else

Healer class
Monks and Nuns have also got some new abilties, with 'Bandage mastery' to stop the bleeding, and 'medical ingrendients' that will help pay for:
New perk 'field triage' - lets you spend 5 medicine to heal 1 hitpoint in battle

Repair class
Blacksmiths and Seamstresses are not to be outdone, in addition to two tool storage perks, they have picked up
New perk 'field repairs' - lets you spend 5 armor parts to repair 1 point of damage in battle

Chef Class
Butchers, bakers and servants can help out too with:
New perk 'field treats' - lets you spend 50 food to bring mercenaries from wavering to steady

Staff Skills
We have had staff mastery for a while, but it was mainly used by the seer. Now we have added two more perks to make staves a more interesting option
New Perk 'Staff Spins' - Any staff hit that would usually daze, also stuns
New Perk 'Staff blocks' - Wielding a staff grants +20 melee defense

**Greatsword skills**
Sword mastery split into sword mastery and greatsword mastery.
Sword mastery - Riposte has no pentalty to hitchance, Slash, Gash and Lunge gain +5% chance to hit
Greatsword Mastery - Split, Swing, Overhead Strike and Great Slash gain +5% chance to hit
Greatswords are Greatsword, Longsword, Warbrand and Rhomphaia
Greatswords have Great Slash Instead of Slash. Great Slash costs 3 more fatigue, but grants +30% armor penetration.
New Perk 'Forceful Swings' grants +10% damage to AOE attacks

**Spear skills**
New Perk 'Spearwaller' grants -25% fatigue usage on spearwall, stacks with spear mastery
New Perk 'Thrust Master' grants +15% damage on the 'Thrust' skill

**Other new skills**
New Perk 'Assured Conquest' - 10% melee skill, melee defense and range dfense when at confident moral.
New perk "smackdown" knockback enemies when you have more health and fatigue than them. added to hammer group
New perk "smashing shields" deal +10% shield damage on any hit, added to axe group
'Sling mastery' adds much more accuracy than before, though slings also begin with less accuracy. Slingstaves also have 'bash'

**Better obituaries**
Integrates Boyski's Entire Better Obituaries mod into Legends, showing each mercenary's background, traits, stats and talents.

**Shield Rework**

Adds paintable tower shields, with 'fortify' skill to shields surrounding allies and 'safegaurd' skill to sacrifice some of your own defence to shield someone else.
Towershields available at armorsmiths or near military attached locations, or will spawn on shieldmaidens and soldiers.

- Nerfed Barter values gain from backgrounds alone
- Reduced the Helmet Perk tree group into Light(+Lookout) and Heavy(+SteelBrow) trees for dynamic trees system.
- Tweaked the guarenteed perk groups for HedgeKnights(+Mace, +Hammer, +Sturdy, +Indestructible), Swordmasters(-XBow, -Heavy, +Light, +Cleaver, +Throwing, +Dagger), Barbarian (+Fit, +Mace, +Cleaver), BeastHunter (+Calm, +Medium, -Heavy), Hunters (+Fit), ShieldMaidens(+Large, +Indestructible), Sellswords (+Fit), Witchhunters (+Calm)

15.0.0.0
Looking for some brave beta testers. This is a playable build with 1.4.0.35 version.
This *DOES NOT* have any Legends content fully integrated with the new DLC content (we are working hard on those parts).
To allow us to continue adding in and integrating the new content we are looking for people to help look for
any major issues (crashes or errors in the log files)
Please do not play this and expect things to work flawlessly.
Do not tell me that the southern armors are not layered, or X skill or X perk isn't balanced, etc...
To REPEAT! Looking for crashes or any errors in log files.
