### Legend Mod Release Notes

## 17 - Of Flesh and Faith

DLC Compatibility
  - Anatomists and Oathtakers have been made Legends compatible.
  - All events that give non-OFaF armors have been converted to layers.
  
Perk Balance
  - With Throwing Mastery, damage increase at 2 tiles distance has been reduced to 30% instead of 40%.
  - Footwork skill fatigue cost reduced to 20 from 25.
  - Head Hunter no longer loses stacks on misses.

Weapon Balance
  - Two Handed Wooden Flail damage increased to 30-60 from 25-60.
  - Two Handed Flail damage increased to 45-90 from 40-80.
  - Orc Flail min damage up to 50 from 40.
  - Cascade skill (Three Headed Flail) fatigue cost reduced to 13 from 15.
  - Pound skill (Two Handed Flails) now ignores an additional 20% of armor on hits to the head with Flail Mastery and 10% without Flail Mastery. 
  - Handgonne effectiveness against armor reduced to 90% from 100%.
  - Split and Swing skills now gain +10% to hit (total +5%) from Sword Mastery up from +5% (total +0%).
  - Aimed Shot skill now costs 20 fatigue, down from 25, and costs 7 action points, down from 8.
  - Shield damage multiplier on named weapons increased to 1.5x-2.0x, up from 1.33x-1.8x.

Northern Sling Rebalance
  - Default accuracy debuff reduced to -5 from -40.
  - Hit chance modifier per tile of range changed to -4 from 3.
  - Sling Mastery now reduces default accuracy debuff to 0 from -5.
  - Sling Mastery now reduces hit chance modifier per tile of range from -4 to -2.
  - With these changes, the sling will now act more like a traditional ranged weapon, losing accuracy based on distance. However, with Sling Mastery, it becomes the best weapon for range at -2 to hit per tile compared to -3 or -4 for Bow or Crossbow. Add Ballistics and you now have no penalty to hit based on distance. This rebalance should keep the theme and use case of the Northern Sling alive while making it more balanced and realistic of a weapon.

Backgrounds
  - Hiring and daily cost changes.
    • Brawler: 125 from 120.
    • Deserter: 85 from 100.
    • Disowned Noble: 135 from 60. Daily Cost 17 from 18.
  - Alchemist background type changed to Educated from Female, Combat and Performing.
  - Qiyan background type added Combat in addition to Female and Performing.
  
Enemy Balance
  - Kraken now has less health and destroying tentacles inflicts a higher minimum damage to the Kraken as a whole.
  - Ijirok now has slightly more health and slightly better stats.
  - 'Chilled' status effect now lasts for two turns instead of one. It now applies -3 Action Points and -50 Initiative the first turn, and -2 Action Points and -30 Initiative on the second.
  - Orc Warlords now have the Captain perk/effect and the Resilient perk.
  - All ancient dead have gained +10 resolve, buffing their fearsome perk.

Item Balance
  - Alp Trophy Necklace value increased from 250 to 400.
  - Hexen Trophy Necklace value increased from 250 to 550.
  - When using Berserker Mushrooms, morale checks are no longer triggered on HP loss.

Other Balance
  - Set the default settlements to 19 (vanilla) instead of 27. This was done in consideration of balance. 19 settlements is what the game was designed around. More settlements than this means more patrols and more caravans, leading to less dangerous roads and travel. Players are of course still free to adjust this according to their own preferences.
  - Changed the relations gain/decay effect of the Negotiator(Meeting Point) to 15%, up from 10%, as they did in Vanilla.

Typos
  - Fixed Disowned Lady background using the Farrier description.

Fixes
  - Hopefully fixed a bug where orcs did full weapon damage even when disarmed.

**dynamic perks**
Over the past few releases we've been trialling custom perk trees for different backgrounds, and your feedback has been overwhelmingly positive about this idea. While running these trials, we have also been building up a perk library, with the goal of massively increasing the perks available to all mercenaries.
With this release we have gone all out and given every mercenary you hire a unique perk tree. We have assembled a library of over 260 perks, then arranged them into groups of perks that have synergy together.
We then assigned those groups by hand to each background, so that every background had gauranteed access to thematically appropriate perks.
However, those background groups only make up half of each mercenary's tree. The other half is randomly picked from the perk groups, providing variety while retaining the synergies.
Each mercenary gets 6 of the 15 weapon groups, 2 of the five defence groups, and eight from the 13 traits, 8 enemy groups and 6 class groups. This provides millions of possible combinations.

Unarmed skills
Unarmed skill has always been strong in legends, it scales off initiative and hitpoints. Now there are three new perks to give more depth:
New Perk 'Kicking' - Active skill to push back and fatigue enemies
New Perk 'Grappling' - Active skill to stun and fatigue enemies
New Perk 'Unarmed Mastery' -Reduces fatigue and increase armor penetration unarmed attacks
Of course brawlers are gaurantees all three.

Medium armor skills
There is a very strong nimble vs battleforged divide that drives mercenaries to the extremes. We wanted to break this dichotomy and encourage other kinds of armor.
New Perk 'Balance' grants up to 30 bonuse melee and ranged defense if your current body armor is equal to twice your current initiative. The bonus decreases for every point of difference between the two, to a minimum of +5.
New Perk 'Matching Set' grants up to 5 fatigue per round if your helmet and armor values match.
New Perk 'Lithe' - Like nimble, but with the 15 fatigue floor raised to 30, and the damage mititgation reduced.

Bard class
You'll find minstrels and troubadours have some new tricks up their sleeves, having gained Daze and Entice to control the battlefield. They also have
New Perk 'Drums Of War' - active skill to reduce the fatigue of all allies

Stealth skills
Devious backgrounds can get a little sneaky
New Perk 'Camouflage' - Master of concelement and blending in. Can hide from enemies in any terrain until next attack or moving adjacent to enemy. Can't be activated if adjacent to enemy.
New Perk 'Blend In' - Makes enemies 50% less likely to attack you instead of someone else

Healer class
Monks and Nuns have also got some new abilties, with 'Bandage mastery' to stop the bleeding, and 'medical ingrendients' that will help pay for:
New perk 'field triage' - lets you spend 5 medicine to heal 1 hitpoint in battle

Repair class
Blacksmiths and Seamstresses are not to be outdone, in addition to two tool storage perks, they have picked up
New perk 'field repairs' - lets you spend 5 armor parts to repair 1 point of damage in battle

Chef Class
Butchers, bakers and servants can help out too with:
New perk 'field treats' - lets you spend 50 food to bring mercenaries from wavering to steady

Staff Skills
We have had staff mastery for a while, but it was mainly used by the seer. Now we have added two more perks to make staves a more interesting option
New Perk 'Staff Spins' - Any staff hit that would usually daze, also stuns
New Perk 'Staff blocks' - Wielding a staff grants +20 melee defense

**Greatsword skills**
Sword mastery split into sword mastery and greatsword mastery.
Sword mastery - Riposte has no pentalty to hitchance, Slash, Gash and Lunge gain +5% chance to hit
Greatsword Mastery - Split, Swing, Overhead Strike and Great Slash gain +5% chance to hit
Greatswords are Greatsword, Longsword, Warbrand and Rhomphaia
Greatswords have Great Slash Instead of Slash. Great Slash costs 3 more fatigue, but grants +30% armor penetration.
New Perk 'Forceful Swings' grants +10% damage to AOE attacks

**Spear skills**
New Perk 'Spearwaller' grants -25% fatigue usage on spearwall, stacks with spear mastery
New Perk 'Thrust Master' grants +15% damage on the 'Thrust' skill

**Other new skills**
New Perk 'Assured Conquest' - 10% melee skill, melee defense and range dfense when at confident moral.
New perk "smackdown" knockback enemies when you have more health and fatigue than them. added to hammer group
New perk "smashing shields" deal +10% shield damage on any hit, added to axe group
'Sling mastery' adds much more accuracy than before, though slings also begin with less accuracy. Slingstaves also have 'bash'

**Better obituaries**
Integrates Boyski's Entire Better Obituaries mod into Legends, showing each mercenary's background, traits, stats and talents.

**Shield Rework**

Adds paintable tower shields, with 'fortify' skill to shields surrounding allies and 'safegaurd' skill to sacrifice some of your own defence to shield someone else.
Towershields available at armorsmiths or near military attached locations, or will spawn on shieldmaidens and soldiers.

15.0.0.0
Looking for some brave beta testers. This is a playable build with 1.4.0.35 version.
This _DOES NOT_ have any Legends content fully integrated with the new DLC content (we are working hard on those parts).
To allow us to continue adding in and integrating the new content we are looking for people to help look for
any major issues (crashes or errors in the log files)
Please do not play this and expect things to work flawlessly.
Do not tell me that the southern armors are not layered, or X skill or X perk isn't balanced, etc...
To REPEAT! Looking for crashes or any errors in log files.

**New Painter Tent**
Paint system has been replaced with a new Painter tent found in your camp screen

**Contract Negotiations**
In Vanilla, when negotiating a contract, the default meta action was to always negotiate once, and then accept because there was a no harm. No more!

When negotiating for more pay:
*There is a 66% chance that relations will be hurt (10% if you have negotiator follower) (It was 100% chance in Vanilla)
*There is always a chance that negotiations will completely fail and the contract is lost. Starts out 10% chance and increases to 90% chance over time. (in Vanilla, this was guarenteed to always happen after either 2 or 3 rounds)
*If fail doesn't happen, there is the same incremental 10-90% chance negotations are ended or successfull.
*The negotiator retinue member slows that 10% to 90% climb in half.
*If successfull, 3% to 10% increase in pay (6% to 15% if negotiator)

When negotiating for advanced pay:
*If you don't have negotiator retinue, there is a 10% chance of relation hit.
*Higher chance of ending negotiations, but no longer can the contract be completley failed.
*If successfull, a 15% to 30% advanced in pay (30%-60% with negotiator).
*If over 50% increase, negotiations are completed. (75% with negotiator)

15.0.1.5

Merges in newest builds 

**Mod integrations**
Integrates Sato's Retinue changes
*The Agent: Instead of affecting faction relation growth/decay, the Agent instead reveals active settlement situations (e.g. Ambushed Trade Routes) as well as contracts when you hover over one on the world map. It's thematic, keeps her relevant for planning your next move when you're not doing contracts, and helps justify her really difficult unlock requirements and high price.
*The Negotiator: In addition to his current effects, he gets the Agent's old relations growth/decay boost. His cost has been bumped to 3500 crowns (up from 3000) to compensate. This felt thematic and helps make him a more attractive retinue member late game.
*The Scout: Renamed to "the Guide", because that's what he does. Instead of increasing your speed by 15% on all terrain, he now reduces the speed penalty of "rough terrain" (forests, swamps, etc. and not snow or desert) by 15%. To help explain this a bit more: the old ability made you move 7.5% faster on swamps, 9.75% faster on forests, and 15% faster on plains  - the new one is 15%, 15%, and 0%. In practice, this should make the Scout/Guide more relevant for difficult terrain, but make him less of an auto-pick for every map and point of the campaign.

Integrates MrBrut's Tactical Hit factors mod
*Adds enhanced hit chance and resistance info when aiming at an opponent

Redback Silk Cloak -> now requires 2 redback poison glands (up from 1) - Same as dagger, very powerful item.
Warlock's Cloak -> no longer requires dark tunic. Strange meat (x1) now replaced with human carrion (x1) as it was before - Meat often expired before crafting completed, it also made it a powerful unique item any run could get.
Warlock's Hood -> no longer requires dark hood (x1), now needs a simple hood (x1). No longer requires strange meat (x1), requires human bones instead - See warlock cloak for rationale on this change.
Heraldic Helmet Ornament -> REMOVED - same as tabard.
Redback Helmet -> Changed from 1 redback poison gland to 3 - Very powerful item and too easy to get.
White Wolf Helmet -> changed from 2 white wolf pelts to 3 - Same reasoning as redback items. Too powerful to be so easily accessible.
Company Tower Shield -> changed from 2 quality wood to 3 - expensive item that could be resold for significant profit as an exploit. Heater and kite shield unchanged.

* The backline ranged spam of bandit rabble has also been capped off to you should see fewer groups of 10+ rabble poachers.
* Early game groups now have a weaker backline, resulting in fewer units to chase down and kill - making solo starts less painful to grind through.

## 15.0.1.19
**Changes** 
Stollwurms get Battle Flow
Integrate Leonion's bigger log mod (top version for now, as bottom version has problems with scaling)
Return item contracts with a bribe will show original contract reward when the bribe is offered

===Katar dagger;===
Now has deathblow instead of puncture, damage increased by 5
Has 15 more durability (now 75)
Has 10% more direct damage

===Caravan AI;===
Caravan hands will be more eager to engage enemies in melee (or chase down ranged units), however they will not break formation.
Caravan hands will stay in formation a little more often (and will split up less)
Caravan hands have a stronger desire to finish opponents off that are near death or fleeing (which means they spread their damage out less)
Caravan hands will avoid engaging multiple opponents at once (no more rushing headfirst into 3 orc warriors), unless the donkey is in danger
Caravan hands will dogpile enemies engaged by allies more often (this increases their effectiveness by a large margin)

Typical behaviour is now;
Is the donkey in danger? if not, stay.
Is another caravan hand in combat or a donkey engaged? If so, engage.
Are all nearby enemies dead and no caravan hands engaged? If so, return to donkey.
Am I (or the donkey) being hit with a ranged weapon by an enemy within a distance I can reach in a turn? If so, engage unit.

* Caravan hands are still very defensive but only on legendary combat difficulty

===Attachments;===
Gladiator attachments;
Light attachment dura up from 35 to 45
Heavy attachment dura up from 60 to 75

All attachments halfed in price, except for gladiator attachments and attachments made from beasts (unhold fur cloak, whitewolf cloak, etc.)

===Named Shields;===
Undead heater shield durability improved from 32 to 35
Undead kite shield durability improved from 48 to 51
Result: undead named shields and item farming made marginally less pointless.
- undead shields are now much stronger in durability but still weak statsically.

===Southern Attached locations, pt.2;===
Southern attached locations now spawn related tents for legends...
Incense Dryer = enchanting + crafting tents
Plantation = healing + gathering tents
Silk Farm = repair + salvage tents
Stone Watchtower (Southern) = scouting + training tents
Miltia barracks = fletching tent
Goat farm = hunting tent

===Tumble and Lunge;===
Tumble now increases AP cost of lunge to 3, not 2.

**For modders**
Perks, skills, backgrounds & endings can now all use a new shared gendered pronoun system. Look at adventurous noble for an example on how to use it. z_legends_language.nut for source


**Fixes**
Makes the new green retreat flag work properly with a variable tooltip
Changes a lot of enemies from having innate resistances or skills to having the appropriate perk

## 15.0.1.20

**Changes**

*Roster Changes*
Roster size is now tied to the scenario's "roster tier" and your amount of active retinue hires
Noble starts at tier 2, Beggars start at tier 0, Peasant Militia at tier 6, everything else at tier 1
  T0 : 1,
  T1 : 6,
  T2 : 9,
  T3 : 12 / 13,
  T4 : 16 / 19,
  T5 : 18 / 21,
  T6 : 25 / 27
Only peasant militia can get tier 6
Removes +Roster perks from player characters

*Ranger origin rework*
Druid scenario now changed to "Legacy" - is currently marked for deletion or complete rework and is no longer supported. Druid now merged into ranger origin.

- Difficulty dropped from 2 to 1
- Now starts with a Druid - the druid and ranger are friends and both count as player characters. If one dies the game will continue. If both die the game will end.
- Druid and ranger are both commanders and share the burden of increasing roster size. If one dies the other may still expand the company but only at half the total sum.
- Intro re-written
- Druid now has a good and bad ending
- Starting druid and ranger backgrounds for this scenario have new flavour text
- All outdoor recruits gain pathfinder and cost 25% less
- Recruits that do not like the outdoors will instead have the default baseplate and not get pathfinder. They also have a 25% increased cost
- Small chance of finding rangers and druids in recruitment pools
- Average chance of finding a herbalist in recruitment pools
- Good chance of finding wildmen/women in recruitment pools

*Recruitment*
- If a background is tagged as a ranger or druid they will gain 25% less upkeep and cost when hired.
- Everyone else costs 25% more
- Backgrounds that are not ranger or druid tagged will not gain pathfinder

see the legends wiki on backgrounds to see who is tagged as a ranger or druid

*Lone wolf rework*
- Lone wolf now starts with the "favoured enemy: swordmaster" perk
- Squires, blacksmiths and hedge knights spawn more frequently
- Blacksmiths, squires and hedge knights have a 15% upkeep and purchase reduction

*Throwing axes*
- Normal/named: armour damage increased from 1.1 to 1.3
- Heavy: armour damage increased from 1.15 to 1.35

this should make throwing axes more viable at destroying armour rather than being inferior to throwing javelins

*Background type changes*
these changes influence recruitment for specfic origins. They are being rolled out slowly so there will be more to come.
- Nomad is now a ranger and outlaw recruit
- Blacksmith, Inventor and Swordmaster are no longer ranger recruits
- Blacksmith is now marked as a noble (they serve nobles and armies)
- Swordmaster is now educated (due to their experience and wisdom)

*Integrates MAR (Medium Armor Rework by  LordMidas and Lukas Tenschouko)*
Balance (tier 2) - Gain up to +15 Melee and +5 Ranged Defense. The bonus increases as you wear armor of heavier weight (penalty to Maximum Fatigue) but slowly drops when your Current Initiative is less than twice your armor weight. This drop is faster for heavier armors.

Perfect Fit (tier 3) - The penalty to Initiative from head and body armor is reduced by 30% and all skills build up 15% less Fatigue. These bonuses drop exponentially when your armor weight (penalty to Maximum Fatigue) is greater than half of your Maximum Fatigue after gear.

Lithe (tier 6) - Damage to hitpoints and armor is reduced by 30% when the total penalty to Maximum Fatigue from head and body armor is between -25 and -35. Outside this range the bonus drops exponentially. As your armor takes damage, this bonus drops slowly to half its maximum value at 0 armor remaining.

In the Zone (tier 7) - Melee Defense and Melee Damage are increased by 1% every time you dodge a melee attack, up to a maximum of 25%. The bonus drops by 2% whenever you get hit. If your initiative is greater than twice your armor weight (penalty to Maximum Fatigue) you start the battle with a pre-applied bonus equal to your armor weight above 15.

- MSU adds a new WeaponType system which automates this.m.Categories creation for weapons and allows for SIGNIFICANT simplification of how perks like Legends weapon specialist skills work (look at perk_legend_specialist_butcher_damage or similar) as well as increased reliability

Two new origin reworks.
**Cultists**
- Three new backgrounds: Husk, Magister and Lurker.
 - Only available to the cultist origin.
 - The purpose of these backgrounds is to give cultists better cohesion while staying on theme.

New Backgrounds explained:
- Husks are cultists who have had the presence of another being ripped from their mind - they are erratic, fast and incredibly strong fighters - if you can control them.
- Magisters are the older and wiser cultists - typically leaders of sects and organised groups. They are revered by other cultists and are often parential figures of cultist groups. Their bond with their god is much stronger.
- Lurkers prefer keeping their enemies at arm's reach - skulking at the corners of your vision and waiting until for the right time to strike. They are proficent in ranged combat and scouting but are very weak physically.
- These backgrounds are unique to the cultist origin and cannot be found outside of it.

Events:
- Cultist events for sacrifice are now significantly more spaced apart and require 4 valid candidates to trigger (as opposed to 2).
- Husks, lurkers and magisters cannot be sacrificed. But are valid for other cultist events.
- The Cultist conversion event has not been changed in terms of requirements. However the 3 new backgrounds may convert others.
- 3 new cultist backgrounds added to cultist joiner events
- Bros that are not cultists who witness sacrifice events will not immediately turn angry and leave, unless they were unhappy already.

Skills & recruitment:
- Buffs and clarifications to the ninetails perktree
- All Cultists are 25% cheaper to hire and maintain. Non cultists are scared of you and cost 25% more to maintain and recruit.
- You may now find more cultists in all towns. Magisters, Husks and lurkers may also be found in towns or during settlement events like the cultist procession. However they are more rare than normal cultists
- Cultists you recruit now gain the "true believer" perk. Backgrounds that are not cultists do not gain this perk.
- Cultists now start at tier 2. Giving them 9 total recruitment slots on day 1.
- Cultist starting roster changed, now starts with: 1 Husk, 1 Magister, 1 Lurker, 2 normal cultists.

- Starting cultists now also start with better weapons than before.
- Cultists and husks have the net perktree.
- Cultists, husks, magisters and lurkers all have favoured enemy noble (and caravan) perks.
- All cultists cannot roll the "slack" trait.

Crafting & ninetails perktree:
- Changes to items, crafting and ninetails perk tree;
- Scouring: now 20% of resolve (up from 10%) 50% applies to other whips, flails and chains including; two handed flails, two handed wooden flails, pole flails, chain and reinforced flails. Does not apply to orc chains.
- Dedication: now 25% of resolve (up from 10%). Works with Cultist leather hood, leather helmet, decayed sack helm, warlock hood or mask of davkul.
- Flesh Mortification: chain added to benefit from this perk.
- Penance: Now gain +75% (up from +50%) of missing health as resolve  while wearing cultist robes, sackcloth, hide, warlock robe or leather wraps.
- Players can now craft a sack hood vanity layer in crafting, the cost for this item is the dedication perk on a brother and 1 bolt of cloth.

**Crusader**
- Crusader origin dropped from difficulty 3 to difficulty 1.
- Crusaders can now meet pilgrims.
- New background: Pilgrim. Pilgrims are followers which range from farmers to nobles. Some are better equipped than others but all of them are resolute in their faith. While unreliable in combat the sight of a fellow pilgrim falling in battle is nothing to worry about. You may find pilgrims in settlements, they cost nothing to hire and a fraction of gold to upkeep. Pilgrims do not trigger morale checks for non pilgrims when they die, however they are weak fighters.
- Pilgrims are unique to this origin and cannot be found outside of it.
- Crusader commander starts with rebound, fortified mind and favoured enemy: zombies.

Recruitment:
- Squires cost 15% less to buy and upkeep and get fortified mind.
- Higher chance of finding pious backgrounds in settlements.
- Monks, nuns, witch hunters and other pious backgrounds (including crusaders) cost 25% less to buy and upkeep and get fortified mind.
- You cannot hire outlaws, Brothers that are not pious or squires will cost 25% more to buy and upkeep and not get fortified mind.

**Balance**
- Heavy tier embalmed can spawn with a variety of weapons now - not just rows of fan axes.
- Swordstaff: Increased durability to 65 (was 56).
- Longsword rebalanced: longsword now has 10% chance to hit the head (up from 5%), and costs 2 less stamina to equip (is now -8, not -10). This also applies to the named varient.
- Nomads have been rebalanced again. You should see more outlaws and fewer cutthroats lategame. Possibly also fixes the issue with trios of executioners showing up frequently.
- Summon bear removed from ranger (druid still has it) due to ranger origin having issues with spawning 2 bears at once.
- Conscript: Removed Nimble, added Dodge/Relentless
- Removed the Shieldwall skill from Tower Shields, they now only have Fortify (except ancient dead tower shield).

  - Medium armor "Balance" perk reworked: Gain +15 Melee Defense when wearing head and body armor with a total weight (penalty to Maximum Fatigue) of 35. The bonus drops by 1 for every 2 points of deviation from this value, and for every 10 points that your Initiative is below twice your armor weight. Gain a third of the Melee Defense bonus as Ranged Defense.
  - Medium armor "In the Zone" perk tweaked: Now grants 0.5% bonus per stack to Melee Skill and Melee Damage per enemy miss against you, up to a maximum of 12.5%. The Melee Damage bonus is doubled when engaged in melee up to maximum of 25%. If your Initiative is higher than 2x your armor weight (penalty to maximum fatigue) you start the battle with stacks equal to your armor weight above 15.

**Misc**
- Lone wolf is no longer so lonely - they start with a squire now.
- The "loyal" trait now stipulates that it makes brothers who have it are immune to charmed effects.
- World economy settlement status effects for adding or losing locations now have new art, which should allow them to be recognised more easily.

- Replaces Warlock origin.
- Difficulty increased from 2 to 3.
- Some warlock skills pulled from rotation (not removed).
- New story given.
- Composed of 4 (new) backgrounds
  - Summoner - Sickly since they were a child, is the only one of the trio that is skilled enough to summon undead.
  - Preserver - Spry and fast she has dedicated her life to mending and preserving corpses.
  - Possessor - Lazy and has mastered the use of controling the dead to carry out mundane tasks. Focuses on possession and offensive spells.
  - Puppet - mindless undead. But still useful. You may find them in town recruitment pools.
- Puppet mechanics
  - Is now a dedicated background.
  - Can be "hired" in town for nothing. If zombies are not fed they will wander off in search of prey.
  - Trait: Rotting flesh - only on zombies, consumes 3 food a day per zombie. Zombies will quickly desert if food is not availible. However they have much more health and no talent stars. Excluded from having most traits.
  - Can bite enemies, causing large amounts of damage directly to health and making humans raise from the dead if killed by a bite.
  - Puppets are mostly immune to mental, health and fatigue related injuries (however they can still be charmed).
- Skill changes
  - Scythe perks now apply to warscythes (and their named variants).
  - Possession now costs more to perform.
  - Zombie summons now changed; zombies do not have a ranged varient anymore.
  - Low zombie: now costs 4 AP, 18 fatigue and costs 15 HP to summon. Needs 1 human carrion to summon. Taking this perk grants +10 health.
  - Medium zombie: now costs 5 AP, 25 fatigue and costs 25 HP to summon. Needs 1 human carrion to summon. Taking this perk adds 30 medicine to your stash and increases medicine stash total by 30.
  - High zombie: now costs 8 AP, 35 fatigue and costs 35 HP to summon. Needs 1 human carrion to summon.

**New origin rework: Peasant Militia**
- Mostly unchanged in premise.
- Two new backgrounds: Leech Peddler and Night Watch.
- Recruiting rules
  - Can only hire lowborns.
  - Start with the full roster size without having to raise renown.
  - Veteran perks were 3, now they are 2 for starters - this should make your starters more important.
  - Militia gain "hate for nobles" trait on start and on hire.
- General changes
  - Militia lose reputation with noble houses more quickly than other origins. But cannot fall below "cold" unless done intentionally. The loss is based off how many lowborns you have in your current roster at midday (when they get paid).
  - Militia origin now spawn and are hired with armbands, regardless of their outfit.
  - Militia now remain as a fixed look on the worldmap when they hit professional and complete the related ambition.
  - Militia now start with an extra bag of grain, which should give them one more day of rations.
  - Militia now use militia baseplates in battle.

**Fixes**

- Hopefully fixed Rotation crash by disabling the think function during IsExecutingSkillMove of skill_container (MSU).

**Balance**
- Multiple weapon prices have been rebalanced - although over 20 weapons have been tweaked, the key offenders were 2 handed max tier weapons that were often the same price or lower of their one handed counterparts. Max tier weapons should now be higher in value and weapons before that should have better spacing and consistancies regarding their value and place in the progression of weapons.
- Jester hat rework - loses 10% chance to hit the head. Equipping gives the user the "taunt" perk. Makes AI target you more often and increases the surrounded malus effect when worn (lol, lmao).
Skeleton gladiators have been reworked slightly, they now has less AP, better defence and more armour.
- Butcher enemy will no longer spawn with a Knife.
- Increased the Lurker daily wage from 10 to 20.

**Art**
- Noble origin now has a new map marker.
- Legion origin now has a higher quality map marker.
- Some retinue graphics have been tweaked. Mostly shadows.
- Lurker, Husk and Magister now have temp. art backgrounds to identify them better - these are not intended to stay.

**For modders**
- Added a standardized system for adding more perks for submods, and for automated listing of perk groups in tooltips. This is accomplished via the function `addPerkDefObjects` and `updatePerkGroupTooltips` in `this.Const.Perks`(see z_perks_defs.nut). You should use the `addPerkDefObjects` function to add your perks when making a Legends submod, and if you change the perk trees in Legends, you should additionally call the `updatePerkGroupTooltips` function at the end of such changes.
- Added `removePerk( _perk )` and `removePerkGroup( _group )` functions to character_background to remove perks from the character's perk tree. Note: removing the perk from the perk tree doesn't actually remove the perk skill from the character. For that you should additionally use the removeByID of the skill_container.
- Added `hasPerk( _perk )` function to character_background. This can be used to check if the character has a certain perk in their perk tree.
- Added `findPerk( perk )` function to character_background. Checks if the character has the given perk in their perk tree and returns a table containing the Perk and the Row that it belongs to. The return value is a table contaning 3 entries: Row, Perk, PerkDefObject. Returns null if the character doesn't have the given perk.
- Added gender pronouns to Event variables for %randombrother% and %randombrother2%. You can use %they1% for randombrother and %they2% for randombrother2. Similarly for other pronounse like their, theirs, themselves etc.
- Added `addPronounVars( _vars, _bro, _suffix )` function to event.nut which allows you to generate pronoun vars for your event specific bros. You can use this function during onPrepareVars function of your event. For example you can use `this.addPronounVars( _vars, this.m.Candidate, "candidate")` and this will allow you to use gender pronouns for this particular bro like %theycandidate%, %theircandidate% etc. to generate the appropriate gender pronoun "he", "his" or "she", "her" etc.
- Missing DLC now adds error entries to the log during queued script execution.
- Veteran levels are now handled via the onUpdateLevel function of MSU via a veteran levels effect.
- Disabled the `32` is already contained in xyz errors showing up in log.
- Militia now have a hidden trait that effects daily reputation loss (currently set to -0.2 noble/citystate relations per head per cycle), however it connot fall below 30. Use this information as you will.
- Updated MSU to v0.6.20. See MSU Changelog.

- Hunter's cap now encourages other archers to attack you more often, price reduced from 1500 to 1200. Still grants +1 vision.

- Goblin ambusher Resolve changed from 45 to 55.

- Goblin wolfrider Resolve unchanged.
- Goblin leader & shaman Resolve changed from 70 to 95.
- All the above should stop goblins from routing in such large numbers so easily.

- Husk background nerfed slightly.
- Named blacksmith hammer armour damage multiplier reduced from 4.0 to 2.5.
- Crucified crusader now loses battleforged & hammer perks, gains medium armour perks and has cleaver mastery, small stat changes to compensate.
- Harvest rock, tree and bush skills removed - they proved hard to balance and could cause crashes. You can still gain materials by assigning bros with these specialist perks to the gathering tent.
- Damage specialist skills (milita spears, pickaxes, shivs, etc.) up from 4-12 to 6-16 skill with the specified weapon, applies 35% bonus (2-7) instead of 25% to similar weapons (does not apply to whips, instruments or slings).

## 15.0.2.1


**Free Companies**
- Adds in a "Free Company", essentially a company like the player company that scales with the player party's strength.
- These are hostile to the player and considered rival companies, and non hostile to noble houses, etc
- Very first run thru stuff, could use things like stat tweaks/reward tweaks/new outfits/etc
- The map starts with 1 free company and after 150 days a second will appear. There's only one tier of each unit right now
- As your party grows they get more points to buy units with, but their armor starts high given there's only one tier currently
  (In relative need of some more outfits I'm currently reusing outfits, but it's tedious to put in too. Might add lower/upper tiered units if the reception of the idea is good)
- They run slightly slower + see/are seen from slightly higher ranges
- Would like specific feedback on:
  The idea of free companies like this
  Spawning too many units at once? Not enough? (Remember there currently is no higher or lower equipment tiers on each unit, i.e. no light archer it's just archer)
  Should they spawn much later in the game? i.e. the first one appears at day 100/after first crisis instead of on spawn? Maybe if we add an even lower tier of units it can spawn early?
  Anything else you can think of that helps me out

**Fixes**
Fix for 'holy flame' skill causing hangs due to being unable to find convertedcultist background type (Thanks H707).
Adv. noble background now has proper female background text is spawning as a woman, thanks to @Theplahunter for the writing.
Magisters and Lurkers now have flail perktrees, which makes them more in-line with all the other cultist backgrounds.
All crafting items added by legends had a bug that caused them to not display the "is used in crafting tag", this is now resolved.
Violent decomposition skill possibly fixed and has been put back into puppet master background for the cabal origin (Thanks H707).
Necrosavants and necrosavant lords were not spawning with named weapons properly. They should now be registered as champions correctly.
Doublestrike effect now has new art.
- Fixes some issues with outfits causing lockups
- Moves some new cutthroat armor to outlaws for being too heavy
- Fixes unarmed lunge skill tooltip

**Changes**
- Makes the 'cost' of a spider slightly higher, so you should see *very slightly* less of them

**Typos**
Female thief (pickpocket) background typos corrected.
Recruiting ambition not longer refers to pre signed contracts retinue equipment as "recruiter".
Typo corrections to miner specialist perktree.
Lurker background typos fixed.
Negotiator retinue text condensed somewhat - should alleviate some text overlap.

**Crafting**
Witch hunter backgrounds can teach your party how to make wooden stakes. All you need is to have a witch hunter in your party and 1 raw wood (which can be gained from gathering in camp).
Warlock hood recipie changed to include human carrion instead of bones, allowing it to be craftable again for the cabal origin.
Warlock hood and cloak have been slightly tweaked in cost for crafting.

**Balance**
Bear aggression for hitting allies with aoe attacks halfed (1.0 --> 0.5), should stop more serious issues like bear claws being used when 2 allies are in the strike zone.
Cultist sacrifice event minimum cooldown increased from 10 days to 15.
Pies, pudding, porridge, beer, wine, mead and preserved mead now cannot be sold at a direct profit. This should balance out issues with players making upwards of 1K a day just by hunting and gathering.
Injury (not healing) rates while in camp have been reduced somewhat. The multipliers are (before/after); 0.0/0.0, 0.10/0.08, 0.30/0.15, 0.50/0.25. - This will put greater need on temples for fixing injuries rather than them becoming a useless fixture.
Cooking equipment follower no longer gives a healing boost. Provision lifetime is increased by 1 (from 3 days to 4 days).
Great khopesh durability changed from 50 to 54.
'Cheer on' perk now gives 2 action points. The user now only uses 1 action point to cheer on an ally (was 3) and costs 5 fatigue (was 15).
Cabal origin spawnrates for permitted recruits evened out a little more - cultists will spawn more often and puppets slightly less often. Graverobbers/diggers are between the two.
'Penance' perk now adds +5% maximum damage for every hostile entity you are engaged with adjacent to you.
Penance now no longer works with sackcloths, leather wraps and robes.
Necrosavant champions now have the potential to get 2 handed named cleavers (low chance) instead of 1 handed named cleavers.
Necrosavant lords will now spawn with named cleavers correctly, they also gain terrifying visage if they are a champion (lol, lmao).
Low zombie spawn decreased from 4 AP to 3 AP, now costs 10 fatigue. Has a better selction of equipment. Has nine lives.
Medium zombie spawn decreased from 5 AP to 4, costs 20 fatigue (from 25) and 20 hp to summon (from 25).
High zombie spawn decreased from 8 action points to 6. Now costs 25 fatigue (from 35) and costs 30 hp to summon (from 35). 
High zombies will no longer have a chance to spawn without a helmet, have slightly better selection of weapons.
Medium zombies have a better variety of gear to choose from when spawned.

**Origins**
Militia origin now have access to a new background; The Man(woman)-At-Arms.
The Man-At-Arms is a hardened veteran of many battles, or rather, many battles by militia standards. They're strong fighters with a much wider skillset than their militia counterparts with the stronger resolve to boot. But some fights have taken a toll on their body...
Militia origin malus for relationships with nobles decreased from 0.2 reputation loss to 0.1 reputation loss, which should make getting noble related ambitions completed more easily and less of a slog.

This background can turn up in any town, but is quite rare to find. Only availible to the militia origin.

**Art**
New background art for the Man-At-Arms.
New art for doublestrike effect, contains mini also.

**FOR MODDERS**
Strings.nut has now been reordered to hopefully be more helpful to navigate. Perk names have been filed by category with comments as needed.

**MISC**
Risen legion scenario is now marked as [Beta] (so stop fucking asking me about it).
Brigand veterans and raiders now have a chance to spawn with a two handed club in addition to their normal weapon rolls.
Cultist is now a Lowborn, in addition to being an outlaw and cultist type.

## 15.0.2.1b
**Free Companies**
Free companies now show up after day 100 : This will be changed back a bit further later maybe
  (Only one shows up at all now, instead of showing up a second one on day 100)
Potion brewer perk description now correctly notes the amount of apothecary levels for upper level potions, notes the difference between brewing and apothecary leveling

## 15.0.2.1c
**Fixes**
- Free companies no longer throw a ton of errors when they haven't spawned yet (lol? oops)
- Penance perk no longer crashes when leaving combat
- Layers aren't split in half anymore
- Fixes cheer on only giving 1 ap

## 15.0.2.2

**Free Companies**
- The first company now spawns on day 80
- A second company spawns on day 100
- [There's some reasonably undocumented ways to make your own if you really want to jump the gun right now and add themed companies]
- Free company units now have randomized perks available to their own class, e.g. spearmen can roll the early game spear perks
- Added in a few more free company names

**Throwing Spear**
- Throwing Spear converted to use ammo and be refillable. 
- 1 ammo max and costs 6 ammunition to replenish.
- Value changed from 80 to 400.

**Fixes**
- Adds some capitalization in to some perks names
- Fixes issues with Penance.
- Improved tooltip for halberd smite to state it has a 2 tile range.

**Typos**
- Runes no longer state that they will be consumed on being used with equipment, unless they are a shield or weapon rune.
- Zombie summon tooltips updated to match the previous build.

**Balance**
- Mold carrion skill now grants 20 health (up from 10).
- Bandit spawns have been rebalanced somewhat.
- Man-at-arms daily upkeep decreased from 18 to 15.
- Man-at-arms initial cost decreased from 165 to 130.
- Nerfs the possible resolve roll on the cheaper named cloak
- Minstrel War Chant now only recovers 3 fatigue per ally instead of 5.

**Events**
- Man-at-arms and leech peddler have been added to some settlement events when playing as the militia origin.

**MISC**
Traveler's bags no longer use the resolve icon on their stash capacity tooltip line.
Men-at-arms now have blue armbands.
Donkeys now cost no upkeep

## 15.0.2.3

**Free Company**
Adds in outfits for the following:
  Longbow, Billman

Adds in the first "Custom" company:
  Gilded company -> Just has a custom leader outfit, it's so tedious making these outfits. Leader is decked out in gold though 

Adds in lower tiers for the following units:
  Archers, Spearmen, Leader
These use lower tier "catch-all" outfits currently and have lower perk purchasing power + lower stats + can only roll the tier 1 weapons (short bow, spear, etc)
The catch all outfits are basically just randomized nonstyled outfits that would kinda look like your first 25 days or so
Because these are in I'm testing out spawning at day 0 and the next two on day 100/130 (3 is probably too many companies)
The low tier spawns include mostly just low tier archer/spearmen and a single low tier ringleader, (he has a 33% chance to have a katar lol i just think it's cool)

Free company units now have randomized perk allotments. Each unit has a purchasing power and will randomly assign itself perks. Some perks are coupled, e.g. spears getting both damage+matk, but cannot roll one individually, it must purchase both

I'm stressing here that it takes like an hour for 2 units assuming I only need one outfit per unit, *eventually* there'll be more than default brown but I make no promises for how soon

Fixes being able to see them all the time, lol

**Fixes**
The cultist robe blueprint granted by penance now no longer requires a sackcloth, it now requires 1 cloth (bringing the total requirements to 1 cloth and 1 furs). This was mainly due to confusion with the varients of sack apparel in the game. Crafting cost reduced.
Recruits in the militia scenario no longer get two seperate positive moodlets when joining the company.
Militia recruits no longer can have fear of nobles, as this would conflict with their hate of nobles garenteed trait.
Man-at-arms *should* now actually spawn with a blue band, not a red one.
Man at arms doesn't get a new injury every save load
Fixes the porridge skill and the beer buzz tooltips to be accurate to actual %s

**Changes**
Contract-selected bandit and barbarian settlements shouldn't spawn roaming parties anymore
Some more spawnlist changing, should see rabble again, maybe for too long.
Removes darkened equipment on human enemies

**Balance**
Cheer on range reduced by 2 (from 1-3 to 1), now costs 30 fatigue (from 5), action point cost raised from 1 to 4.
Inspire range increased from 1-3 to 1-4.

```Luft's Rationale; cheer on was made to be overpowered by design last patch to test the waters of how flexible people were to more minor skills if the reward was great enough. Cheer on now works as a more localised inspire, having less range and greater fatigue cost but providing a better short term benefit than inspire does. Inspire costs almost all of your AP, but provides a better benefit for longer battles due to having less fatigue cost.
Inventor is now classified as a lowborn.```

'Hate entity' traits now provide +10 resolve, +5% melee and +5% ranged skill. Likewise, 'Fear entity' traits do the reverse, providing -10 resolve, -5% melee skill and -5% ranged skill.
Nachzehrer trophy necklace now reduces resolve of enemies adjacent to you by -3.
The gatherer building has now been tweak for yields from timber and ore hunter perks. Both rough wood and peat bricks may be found more commonly from both respective skills, however quality wood and uncut gems are the same chance as before - this should alleviate issues of players struggling to get raw wood and peat bricks.
Bandit warlords now have much heavier armour choices to spawn with, bandit leaders also have a few heavier outfits to spawn with but also can spawn with medium armour still.

**Typos**
Rust skill now states it uses (current) inititive to calculate damage.
Witchhunter hat typo corrected stating it still gave nightvision.

**For Modders**
The hidden peasant trait used by miltia now removes the fear of nobles trait using the onadded function.


## 15.0.2.4
**Free Company**
Slayers now have 30% chance for a Kite Shield, 30% Heater Shield, 10% Net, 30% No secondary item
Footmen now don't have nets at all, 1/3 chance for each kind of basic shield (Kite/Heater/Wooden)

- Takes free companies out for a bit, they'll still exist if they spawned in your world but I have some checklist of stuff I need to work on before these guys are ready I think. Happy with the general proof of concept so far.

**Fixes**
Switching out layers from armor (either in the stash or on a person) now causes the removed piece to be put in the stash place of the new piece, instead of just being placed in the first open slot
Fuck it. Militia now should defnitely have blue armbands for men at arms because I added them in 3 differant places this time. Im done being merciful.
Noble's cousin now has the same excluded trait rules as the noble commander, this will also stop them spawning with loyal and disloyal traits at the same time. 
Minor fixes for armours that were causing hangs when fighting free company or bandits. If you don't remove your submod for this when updating to this build I will fly to your country, not enjoy your food and then shit on your doorstep.
Patched a critical issue caused by stash space modifications that would prevent players from loading the poacher scenario on legendary economy difficulty.
Fixed a bug where the Nun from the Inquisition origin would get a perk every 5 levels after 11, not 2 as she should do.
Preserver from the Cabal origin no longer spawns as male both in art and base ID.
'Meat hacker' Orc weapon no longer tagged as a two handed weapon - is now tagged as one handed like it should be.
Prosthetic limbs gained via an inventor are removed from a bro when they drink the water of life, allowing them to no longer suffer the negative effects of their prosthetic(s).
Penance now works as intended and doesn't cause crashes (thanks Zdzislaw).
Fixed Blacksmith hammers having slightly more armor penetration than shown in the weapon's tooltip.
Fixed Named Blacksmith hammers having significantly less armor penetration than shown in the weapon's tooltip.
Fixed town wealth exploit with buyback.
Hopefully fixed Drums of War recovering 8 fatigue instead of 3.

Minor fixes for armours that were causing hangs when fighting free company or bandits. If you don't remove your submod for this when updating to this build I will fly to your country, not enjoy your food and then shit on your doorstep. - Luft
Gathering Tent shouldn't just hand you free raw wood anymore, as we've recently added protection to your battle siblings woods.
  (The actual formulas for calculating Quality Wood/Gem drops are the following)
  -500.0 / (levels.Woodsman + 60) + 10 > this.Math.rand(1, 100) :: after this procs if you have a collective level of 11 for Woodsmen/Miners it guarantees a Wood/Gem, otherwise it's a 1/3 chance
  (Actual formula for calculating Raw Wood/Peat Bricks)
  -300.0 / (levels.Woodsman + 60) + 10 > this.Math.rand(1, 100); :: Same 1/3 as above but it requires a collective level of 6 for a guaranteed one
  
**Balance**
Men at arms now have marginally better stats.
Brothers with the scholar perk can now find 10% more loot after battle. Stacks additively.
Push forward now grants +10 melee skill, +5 resolve and +3 melee defence to allies within 4 tiles. Cost decreased from 6 AP to 5 AP.
Incoming now grants +5 ranged skill, +5 resolve and +10 ranged defence to allies within 4 tiles. Cost decreased from 6 AP to 5 AP.
Favoured enemy: swordmaster event tweaks; event cooldown reduced from 60 days to 45 days. beforehand you had to be 10 tiles or more from a settlement for this event to trigger, it is now 8. The brother with this perk must be level 10 or higher to trigger this event now.
NPC militia no longer can spawn with a wooden stick. Instead they can spawn with a saw.
Bandit and nomad spawns rebalanced again, this time using a differant technique. Please report feedback on balance.
Blacksmith stats adjusted: Lost capability as a fighter, gained more stamina.

Inventor's prosthetics now are more balanced when it comes to cost, previously they were all 1000 gold and 20 tools each, with a cooldown of 30 days. Now they are;
```
Finger = 225 gold, 5 tools. Cooldown 20.
Ear = 350 gold, 5 tools. Cooldown 25.
Eye = 600 gold, 5 tools. Cooldown 30.
Nose = 800 gold, 10 tools. Cooldown 35.
Foot = 1000 gold, 10 tools. Cooldown 35.
Leg = 1400 gold, 15 tools. Cooldown 40.
Hand = 1750 gold, 15 tools. Cooldown 40.
Forearm = 2000 gold, 20 tools. Cooldown 45.
```
Each event has been altered slightly in terms of requirements, for example, a missing finger has a lower needed level of crown and tools to be availible to trigger, because it requires less of each than any other injury.

Paint is now no longer a tool, it is a trade resource. All paints have a resource value of 2, except paint remover which is 1. It's type affects it's value, but the dyes required to make them have increased in many cases;
```
Paint remover = 150
Black paint = 160, 1 dye
Red paint = 270, 2 dyes
Orange and red paint = 380, 3 dyes
White, green and yellow paint = 520, 4 dyes
White and blue paint = 645, 5 dyes
Paint set = 760, 6 dyes
```
Dyes have been reduced from 400 value to 110 to allow players to use them to craft paints if they have the requirement(s). Making paints from monster parts is still possible, but now requires a beast slayer background to be present. Costs for crafting paints at a taxidermist universally reduced. Making paints from dyes requires a brother with the scholar perk.

**Typos**
Militia scenario starters now have gender neutral background text.
Cut down negotiator follower (meeting point) retinue text so it doesn't run off the screen anymore.

**New weapon; The Slingshot**
The slingshot is a short ranged weapon that does less damage than the sling, but it's compactness and power can cause great damage and confusion. Slingshots are produced by fletchers and can be found in the hands of poachers. Slingshots benefit from all ranged skills and sling perks. Slingshots are light and require both hands free to use. Art should be credited to Von krolock.

**For modders**
Slingshots do not have a working AI package yet. I tried to get it working but encountered a few issues with it. Please DM me if you'd like the error logs of these tests - Luft.
For now, slingshots should NOT be given to the AI.
Asset_manager's function updateLook now check all origins for updateLook. This means updateLook can be used in a file without needing custom brushes after camping (Thanks to Taro).

**Misc.**
Inventor prosthetic events now have new event text.
Paints have new description text now.
Added in one new tip of the day.
The legendary contracts has a significantly lowered score (Should pick them WAY less now)
  -> If it's still too common let us know

## 15.0.2.5
- Champion Orc Behemoths no longer have adrenaline.
- Consumable items can no longer be used infinitely.
- Doublestrike should have its own effect icon now.
- Drill sergeant follower (training dummies) from the retinue no longer accepts temporary injuries on the listed backgrounds to buy the retinue.
- Bandit rabble should now spawn in bandit groups.
- 'Schrat racial' now takes into account the ranged cascade skill.
- 'Night owl' trait didn't do anything before, it should now be working as intended.

## 15.0.2.6
##The ImPossible Circus##
**Troupe**
- Tavern rumours and drinks are half price as troupe, and you're less likely to get drunk from each round in the tavern. 
- Troubadours are better differentiated from minstels. They are actors and dancers with more well rounded stats 
- illusionist  Has more ranged skill, begins in the back row with a slingstaff, has the fast tree instead of organised and occassionally has premonitions. Is better at ranged, but worse hitpoints and stamina. Begins with revolt instead of entice Revoltecfatigue reduced from 25 to 15 
- Troupe has a chance to find another illusionist at a fair 
- New event between juggler and minstrel or troubador resulting in skill increases or injuries 
- New event between minstrel and troubadour resulting in an occassional mood lift 

**Instruments**
- Drums and lute s hit for less but cost less AP and can be used one handed 
- Named lute cost, AP and damage reduced 
- Drums  count as a staff isntead of a mace, lutes are still maces, so your choice of instrument makes a bigger difference
- Bardbarian drums now drop as loot and are two handed drums. beware, they can also be used against you. 
- Lute Solo max damage reduced from 20 to 10 

**Jugglers** 
- Now have better fatigue, slightly better ranged and lower bravery and hitpoints
- Now guaranteed dagger tree instead of slings. Starts in troupe with javelins
- Leap moved to T1 - fatigue costs halved, and then each point of armor weight increases the fatigue cost. Staff mastery increases its range by 1 tile while wielding a staff.  
- Rotation added at T3 
- New Perk Twirl added at T4 - upgrades Rotation to optionally target enemies
- New Perk Backflip at T6 - upgrades Footwork to two tiles 
- Tumble at T7 now also halves the fatigue cost of Rotation

**Balance**
- Southern slaves rebalanced slightly to be more in-line with their rabble cousins.
- Brigand army contract has been overhauled somewhat. The payout should now be more reasonable and a few typos have been corrected and flavour text restructured. There will always be one warlord that spawns and no more. This warlord will have a mix of vets, marksmen and occasional monks as a personal guard, dynamic spawns will then add to that group.
- Noble house slingers have had their stats adjusted and sling damage perk removed - this should hopefully make them less frustrating to fight.
- Peasant versions of the witchunter, blacksmith and squire have been added into general circulation with roaming peasant groups.
- Southern Arena fights now should scale dynamically based on difficulty factors and are no longer fixed like vanilla. This will make arena fights marginally easier early on and much harder later. (Highly experimental right now, let us know of the balance with the spawns).
- Hold the line now gives +10 Melee defence, immunity to knockback/grab and reduces overall damage taken by 10%. Hold the line costs 9 action points, 30 fatigue and has a range of 4 tiles.
Experimental: High tier ghouls (capable of swallowing bros) have been increased in cost for non-hexe parties. Medium tier ghouls lowered in cost slightly. This may help with too many high tier 3 ghouls at later levels.
- Black monolith garrison buffed. Adds in a few legends enemies to the roster.
- Witch's hut greatly buffed. Now includes various legendary monsters (calm down it's not 11 stollwurms).
- 'Obsidian Dagger' item considerably buffed.
- The Escape Artist perk now reduces the Action Point cost of breaking free from a net and helping an ally break from from a net by 1.

**Bandit Warlord Rebalance**
- Overall, Warlords are now stronger and more independant entities that act as a hardpoint in a garrison. Warlords still carry named items.
- Warlords now have 'Rally the troops', 'True believer', 'Lone wolf', 'Composure', 'Underdog' and 'Full force' by default.
- Warlords get 'Battleheart' on legendary combat difficulty.
- Xp reward upped from 800 to 1000.
- Action points increased from 9 to 11.
- Hitpoints from 200 to 225.
- Resolve from 140 to 180.
- Melee skill from 110 to 135.
- Melee defence from 30 to 45.
- Ranged defence dropped from 30 to 25.
- Initiative from 170 to 185.
- Fatigue recovery rate from 25 per turn to 30 per turn.
- To compensate for these buffs, Bandit Warlords now only spawn in forts and other garrisons, not in roaming parties. Their cost for spawning is now higher than normal and capped to avoid multiple warlord spawns.


**Fixes**
- Alps now have resistance to the ranged cascade skill in their racial files.
- Fixed an issue with drill sergeant follower (training dummies) in the retinue giving errors (REMOVE YOUR PATCH FROM LAST BUILD).
- Fixed legend chain skills (flail and hook) being 4 range instead of 3.
- Prayer of faith perk now harms normal cultists and converted cultists as intended.
- Fixed a potential issue where, in theory, a donkey bought by the militia origin could have a red armband due to it being tagged as lowborn.
- Implemented a bandaid fix for the gatherer tent in camp. Hopefully this does the trick.
- Fixed Inspire active skill ID. The wrong ID was causing the active skill to persist even after the perk was removed from a character.
- Fixed the Tumble perk not reducing the Fatigue Cost of skills e.g. Lunge.

**Typos**
- Corrected the language of the parrying dagger description somewhat.
- Made the 'Avatar' trait more obvious in its effects via tooltip.
- Prayer of faith perk now states that it hurts cultists rather than "not working" on them.
- Corrected an incorrect tooltip on 'Field triage' perk, also cleaned up the tooltip it uses.
- 'Fearsome' perk now stipulates that it only triggers once per attacker.
- Minor typo changes to 'meat hacker' weapon.

**For Modders**
- Donkeys are no longer lowborns.
- The militia origin now detects 'stabled' characters and does not move them to garbage on creation.
- Updated MSU to v0.6.26. Check MSU changelog of v0.6.25 and v0.6.26.

## 15.0.2.7
##Juggle This##
- Fixed syntax error in Juggler Background.
- Reverted arena scaling due to bugs.

## 15.0.2.8
##Of Farriers and Flames##
**Balance**
- Blacksmiths can now spawn as females, which are known as Farriers. This is primarily to alleviate the issue where the Sisterhood origin could not craft most of the legendary items without a blacksmith present.
- Blacksmiths are now tagged as lowborns, which allows the militia origin to craft legendary armours.
- Mummies and Alps now receive 1.25x damage from burning damage.

**Fixes**
- Recover should now calculate fatigue recovery correctly.
- Fixes a critical issue in the militia origin.
- Fixes an issue that caused blue armbands not to spawn on men-at-arms.
- Fixed, cleaned up, and improved the tooltips for Hold the Line perk, status effect and active skill.
- Mummies now apply the curse even if an actor kills them without an attack.
- Converted the racial skills to now use MSU based damage type system for damage reduction. This ensures a much more consistent damage resistance system for entities such as skeletons, mummies etc.

**Typos**
- Avatar trait tooltip fixed.
- Crusader scenario text typo fixed.
- Typos corrected when a player hovers over free or locked space in the retinue menu.
- Fixed incorrect tooltip on white wolf mantle attachment.

## 15.0.2.9 - All Fun and Games

- Fixed an issue with the minstrel_and_troubador event causing events to break.


## 15.0.2.10 - A Promise Unfulfilled
**Fixes**
- Fixed being able to equip layer items
- Fixed more infinite consumables
- Fixed web skill showing damage values in the tooltip
- Disowned noble background may now spawn as a full female background, named disowned lady.
- Fixes an issue with the troubadour vs. juggler event.
- Fixed Double Strike mini icon not appearing.
- Fixes an issue where possession was not being dismissed when combat ended.

**Text**
- Added fluff to perk descriptions of Mark Target, Danger Pay, Hold the Line, Forward Push, Bribe, Return Favor, Perfect Focus, Rotation, Footwork, Debilitate, Indomitable, Rally the Troops, First Aid, Sundering Strikes, Bloody Harvest, Immovable Object, Executioner, Steel Brow, Anticipation, Double Strike, Vengeance, Ballistics and Battle Flow.
- Added detail to perk descriptions of Revolt and Entice.
- Improved grammar in Peddler Deal event.

**Typos**
- Fixed an issue with player avatar trait not displaying the information correctly.
- Fixed a few typos in the legends tournament event.
- 'Hunting mummies' contract typos fixed.
- A couple dozen typo fixes thanks to Dimon485.

**Misc**
- A few more tavern rumors have been added.

**For Modders**
- Background parameters such as IsLowborn are now automatically transformed into the BackgroundType system, via convertToBackgroundType() running during a create hook
- onUpdateDraftsList now has Gender as an optional parameter
- These changes improve compatibility with mods
- Removed the `findPerk( _perk )` function from character_background.
- Enhanced the functionality of the `getPerk( _perk )` function in `character_background`. It now takes either a string or a perkDef as its argument and returns the perkDefObject of the perk from this character's perk tree if it has it.
- Implemented `addScenarioPerk( _background, _perk, _row = 0, _addSkill = true )` function in `starting_scenario`. This function should be used to add origin-specific free perks to characters. `_background` is the background of the character, `_perk` is a perkDef, `_row` is the desired row on which to add the perk, note that if the perk already exists in the character's perk tree then `_row` is ignored and the perk remains on that row. `_addSkill` will also add the skill to the character if true, and if false then only adds the perk to the perk tree but doesn't give the perk to the character.
- Added `_isRefundable` argument to the `addPerk( _perk, _row = 0, _isRefundable = true )` function of character_background. The argument defaults to true. If it is set to false, the the perk won't be refunded during `resetPerks()` of actor.
- An existing perk in the perk tree can be made non-refundable by accessing it via `getPerk` to get the perkDefObject and then setting the `perkDefObject.IsRefundable` boolean to false.
- The `onBuildPerkTree` function of scenarios is now called after the perk tree of the character is built, and hence the `PerkTree` and `PerkTreeMap` members of `character_background` can be accessed during this function.
- The Legends version is now saved in the savegame metadata and will be printed in the game log when saving and loading a save file.
- Improved automatic formatting for perk tree mention in perk tooltips.
- Modding: Updated MSU to v0.6.27.

## 15.0.2.11 - Bastard Blades

*New Features**
- Added functionality to remove all layers from an equipped item. (Shift + Right Click)
- Added functionality to equip layers on armor in the stash. (Hold Shift and drag onto a base layer in the stash)
- Added tooltips and new mouse icons for the above functionality.
*Thanks to Taro for these additions!*

**Infantry Axe Rework**
  • Now has the skills Chop(4AP), Split Man(6AP) and Split Shield.
  • Damage: 50 - 70
  • Armor Ignore: 35%
  • Armor Efficiency: 125%
  • Value: 1950

**Longsword Rework**
  • Removed the Swing skill and replaced it with Overhead Strike.
  • Increased headshot chance to 10% from 5%.
  • Fixed Slash skill having 20% armor ignore instead of the intended 25%.

**Balance**
- Armor Piercing Bolts now increase armor penetration damage by 20% (up from 10%), but reduce overall damage by 15% (up from 10%).
- Mercenaries slightly buffed
  • Low level mercs: gain overwhelm, backstabber and a small chance to spawn with heavier armours. Loses battleforged unless on legendary difficulty, gains nimble. Hp raised from 90 to 110, melee defence raised from 20 to 25.
  • Normal mercs: gains smashing shields, crippling strikes. Hp raised from 90 to 110, melee defence raised from 20 to 25.
  • Ranged mercs; gains nine lives on legendary difficulty.
  • Mercenaries have a *small* chance to drop additional loot like silverware, treasure and other trinkets. These only drop from battleforged mercs, not low level light mercs or ranged mercs. Loot based perks and origins (see; raiders origin and scholar perk) can increase these droprates.
- Tweaks made to legendary bandit contract spawnrates and rabble in general. Thugs and low level archers will no longer spawn in the legendary brigand contract location. Rabble should now spawn as normal.
- ALL named shields have had their base durability increased by their current durability divided by 4, then that value added to their current durability. At lower levels, even basic named shields are getting 11 or more extra base durability. This is before random modifiers are applied, which may increase this value further.
- Improved Resilient (holdout) perk. Now grants +8 health (from +6) and raises the chance to survive after being struck down from 33% to 66%. This stacks with other sources of the same effect.
- Undead shields (decayed) lose a small amount of durability but are lighter than their other named counterparts under this change.
