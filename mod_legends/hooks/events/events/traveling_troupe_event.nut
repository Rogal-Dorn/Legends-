It\'s been years since I\'ve heard it.%SPEECH_OFF%The mime, again breaking character, grins and loudly proclaims that they know it. He snaps his fingers and the musicians of the group pick up their instruments. When they start, the tune is instantly catchy. It\'s a stringed and horn orchestration, played alongside a large woman singing from both heart and belly. She is a tempest of a singer, bringing both the quiet and ferocity of a large storm\'s coming and going, and her lyrics are that of incredible heroism of yore.\n\n After the troupe finishes, you ask how much you owe them. The mime shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%No, sir, payment is not necessary. It\'s been awhile since that got requested and it was a pleasure to play it for you.%SPEECH_OFF%";
