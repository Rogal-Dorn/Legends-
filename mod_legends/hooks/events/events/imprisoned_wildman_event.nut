Half-starved, the wild human gnaws on sticks poking out from a tumbleweed of hair. Seeing this sad sight, you grab the stranger by his shirt and slam him against the wagon.%SPEECH_ON%Does that look like an animal to you?%SPEECH_OFF%The animal tamer grins, ivory for teeth. He explains himself.%SPEECH_ON%Cityfolk have gotten wind of the \'uncivilized\' humans and wish to see them up close. I am only fulfilling this new demand as any businessman would. Now, all I need help with is to get that dead body out of the cage.%SPEECH_OFF%He points toward a corpse in the corner of the cage. The wildling rears back, snarling, and goes to protectively sit on the body. The animal tamer shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%One of my helpers got too close and, well, yeah. I can\'t go into town with that mess in there so I thought maybe you could help me fish it out. I\'ll pay plenty, of course. A pouch of 250 crowns sound good to you?

The sellsword easily grabs the boot of the corpse and drags it toward the bars. It slips through with sickening ease, already clumped up in the fashion of discarded wet clothes. Guts and limbs dribble off the edge of the wagon\'s platform. The animal tamer cheers happily.%SPEECH_ON%Thank you so much!

There\'s a black hole where one of his eyes used to be. The wildling squishes the eye between its teeth, a white goop bursting forth like a popped pustule, and it turns into a filmy paste as it chews.
