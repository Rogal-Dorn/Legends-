It\'s just what they do. So you decide to let them hash it out. In time, their voices lower in volume, and their faces lower together into a book. They quietly peruse it, bumping heads as they draw their eyes over the pages. Finally, %monk1% raises up, pointing to some sentence.%SPEECH_ON%There! Right there! \'Man from mud\', not \'man from blood\'. Man can\'t be from blood, he is blood! Man can\'t be from himself, see? Now does it make sense?%SPEECH_OFF%Scratching his chin, %monk2% nods, but then wonders aloud.%SPEECH_ON%What if...%SPEECH_OFF%Before the thought is finished %monk1% slaps the book closed with hands thrown into the air."

So naturally you think these two will do the same. Alas, it isn\'t to be. Their voices grow louder and louder. You never knew the pious could be so sharp-tongued. Fierceness and lewdness don\'t even begin to describe the insults being thrown back and forth. It isn\'t but a few seconds later that they are on the ground, wrestling and punching until you order %otherguy% to put an end to it.\n\nThe company of sellswords and their bloody daywork, it seems, have left a mark on the once peaceful demeanor of the two.";
