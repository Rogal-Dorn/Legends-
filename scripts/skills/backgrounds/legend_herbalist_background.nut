The herbalist eventually left to seek spirituality on their own terms. | As the world\'s suffering grew, %name%\'s abbot requested that she go out and heal the people of the earth - or kill those who did them wrong. | Cults of death, beasts of nightmare, and men of cruelty. %name% left the halls of his temple to purify them all. | But seeing the horrible thigns humans wrought, %name% abandoned the city, seeking out survival by other means. | Unfortunately, his herbs could not save others from slaughter. %name% realized that his herbs wer better invested in looking out for oneself than muttering to some so-called god. | Always fiery, %name% left the safety of the wetlands to go out and heal the world. | One of the few literate men around, %name% abandoned his ascetic life to learn more of the world and, hopefully, to cure that which sickened it. | But one night a woman he bedded concinved him to consider the plight of others,  and they never returned to the swamp. | But he used his trusted position for ill-gotten gains, stealing from the apothecary\'s treasury. It didn\'t take long for the scandal to drive him out. | Unfortunately, there were accusations of witchcraft. Nobody knows the truth behind the story, but %name% did not last much longer at the church. | One night, witnessing a terrible event in the beloved wetlands. Not long after, %name% quickly left the swamp, never quite saying what was discovered.} {The herbalist hardly knows a thing about fighting, but is very skilled at slicing mushrooms quickly and accurately. | Years of solitude and prayer have left %name% out of shape, but it is his quick hands that is of most value. | Perhaps never really content with his life, it\'s difficult to entirely know why someone like %name% would join a band of mercenaries. | Maybe there are too many illnesses in the world, or too many inside, but you don\'t question why %name% wishes to join a band of sellswords. | Medicine won\'t cleave a greenskin, but a sickle might. | %name%\'s stated desire to rid the world of \'the sickness\' is almost scary in its determination. | While %name%\'s knowledge of secret things is to be commended, the constant mutterings to the old gods are a bit annoying. | While %name% may not be used to armor and shields, few mercenaries have the skill with a blade. | A bundle of herbs in hand, %name% has sought the company of sellswords. | The pestle he carries is thick enough to be used as a shield, but %name% looks absolutely horrified when you say as much out loud. | Perhaps with a romantic view of mercenaries in need of a a remedy, %name% seeks to accompany sellswords. | Once having read of warrior priests, %name% now wishes to emulate those brave, unwavering soldiers of faith. | You get the feeling %name% wants release from this sickened world. If that\'s the truth then this is the right place.}";
