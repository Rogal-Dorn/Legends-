Unless ordered, at least. | You threaten to skewer him when he mentions how healthy you look, to which he quickly claims was just a passing compliment.} { Despite it all, %name% is good with a sword, and claims he rarely goes hungry. | A butcher like him will no doubt have little trouble carving the living. | %name% has doubtless had some experience butchering the living before. | Desperate times call for desperate measures, but how desperate are you to hire someone like this? | While some of his… skills… may be tempting, you know if you hire him you’ll never sleep soundly as long as he lives. | The fact that creatures such as this exist makes you want to wretch, but would many not say the same of you? | He eyes you queerly, as if he knows some secret joke that you never will. | When you are done speaking with him, he keeps talking. Quietly. To himself. You do not like what you hear.}";
