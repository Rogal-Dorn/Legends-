One ambush later and %name% was running for her life.} {Now %name% is being sold by a farmer for being too stubborn  | A donkey like %name% is no stranger to danger, making her a good fit for any mercenary group. | With her caravan days behind her, working for a sellsword was just another avenue for oats. | In %name%\'s mind, being a mercenary is a lot like being a caravanner. Just more carrots. | Well versed to traveling, %name% seems like a natural fit to the tasks already befit for a mercenary. | Years of road travel have molded %name% into quite the durable figure.
