As you approach %joiner% and hails the emporer, and is welcomed into the %companyname%. | %joiner% scouted out your party for a time before finding it safe to approach. All it took was the mention of the emporer\'s name and the pact was made. %joiner% joins the company. | the Emporer surely watches over you as a soldier by the name of %joiner% joins the %companyname%. Stating but one purpose, and it was to find you and ensure that this world sees all that awaits it. | %joiner% rises from the dirt as you approach, chanting for the glory of the emporer and his eternal gaze that surely watches over your party whole. The %companyname% takes %joiner% back into the service. | %joiner% calls down from the battlements of a half buried castle, hailing you in the name of the emporer. %companyname% soon welcomes %joiner% back to the legion. | With a nod of a skinless head %joiner% claims to be at the speartip of the emporer\'s purpose. You nod and welcome %joiner% into the %companyname%.  | %joiner% falls in with the company and there is little argument as to why. When asked where %joiner% came from, the answer is a gesture to the ruined fortifications, and the ancient battle to defend the empire.}",
